The widget shows a spreadsheet - either from XLS file or by setting the cell contents programmatically.

This version is very limited:
- All columns and rows have fixed sizes
- No cell styling is supported
- No graphs are supported
- No merged cells are supported
- Performance for larger spreadsheets is really bad
- Only supports Vaadin 7
- Tested with Firefox, Chrome and Safari

Try out the demo to see if it would be useful for you. I mainly built it for an upcoming presentation.
